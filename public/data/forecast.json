  "warning": "These are demonstration forecasts for portfolio purposes. The model uses Spatial K-Fold Cross-Validation to provide honest performance estimates, but predictions should be treated as exploratory analysis rather than validated forecasts.",
  "assumptions": [
    "Housing market conditions remain similar to 2019-2023 trends",
    "BeltLine development continues at projected pace",
    "No major policy interventions (rent control, inclusionary zoning)",
    "Investor activity patterns remain consistent",
    "Population growth follows ARC projections"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Spatial Cross-Validation yields conservative accuracy estimates (~15-20% lower than Random CV)",
    "Model trained on UDP 2019 typology labels - may not capture post-pandemic shifts",
    "Does not account for micro-scale neighborhood dynamics",
    "BeltLine proximity is a dominant feature - model may underperform in areas far from transit corridors",
    "Census tract boundaries may not align with perceived neighborhood boundaries"
