# Displacement Risk Model Evaluation Results

## Scope
- **Study Area**: Downtown Atlanta (8 census tract pilot subset)
- **Validation**: Spatial Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier (n_estimators=100, max_depth=3)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Recall (At-Risk) | **0.80** | Priority metric - minimize false negatives |
| Precision | 0.80 | Trade-off with recall |
| Accuracy | 0.75 | Overall classification accuracy |
| PR-AUC | **0.87** | Handles class imbalance |
| ROC-AUC | 0.83 | Overall discrimination |

## Confusion Matrix

|  | Predicted Stable | Predicted At-Risk |
|--|-----------------|------------------|
| **Actual Stable** | 2 (TN) | 1 (FP) |
| **Actual At-Risk** | 1 (FN) | 4 (TP) |

## Key Features (by importance)

1. Investor activity (0.24)
2. BeltLine proximity (0.21)
3. Rental percentage (0.18)
4. Housing age (0.15)
5. Median income (0.12)
6. Transit access score (0.10)

## Limitations

- **Pilot scope**: Results from 8-tract downtown subset only
- **Small sample**: Leave-One-Out CV approximates spatial validation
- **Synthetic features**: Based on UDP typology patterns, not raw ACS data
- **Production note**: Full city-scale model would require proper Spatial K-Fold with buffer zones
